It allows you to login remotely through your ms_teams account and search for ongoing meetings in all your channels and automatically joins the first one it finds. Full Feature highlights:
- Requires just a one-time setup, asking for your `mas_teams` account details.
- Stores those details in a special `.selemrc` file with modified permissions of `600` for further logins.
- Authenticates and lists all your subscribed teams and channels before searching for meetings.
- Turns off the Camera and Microphone before joining meetings, for respecting user-privacy and not disturbing other participants.
- Stylised unicode terminal outputs for enhanced readability with wide terminal support.
